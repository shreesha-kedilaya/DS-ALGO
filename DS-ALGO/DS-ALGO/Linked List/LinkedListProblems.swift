//Find maximum element from each sub-array of size 'k'| Set 2

/*
 
 If you are given an integer array and an integer 'k' as input, write a program to print elements with maximum values from each possible
 sub-array (of given input array) of size 'k'. If the given input array is {9,6,11,8,10,5,14,13,93,14} and for k = 4, output
 should be 11,11,11,14,14,93,93. Please observe that 11 is the largest element in the first, second and third sub-arrays - {9,6,11,8},
 {6,11,8,10} and {11,8,10,5}; 14 is the largest element for fourth and fifth sub-array and 93 is the largest element for remaining sub-arrays.

//Sum of Two Linked Lists using Recursion | Set 2

//In this post we have covered the recursive solution for finding out sum of numbers represented by linked lists. In that question though, a number was represented in such a way that its unit digit was placed at the end of the linked list. For example, number 98734 would be represented as 9->8->7->3->4.
//
//In this problem, a number is represented in reverse fashion, that is its unit digit is placed at the beginning of the linked list. For example, number 98734 is represented as 4->3->7->8->9. Given this representation, write a program that takes input as two linked lists(which represent two numbers) and returns output as the linked list which is sum of two numbers represented by input linked lists.
//
//Example:
//Input: 1->7->9->9->9->null(number 99971), 8->9->9->null(number 998).
//Output: 9->6->9->0->0->1->null(number 100969)

//Given a linked list, find 'n'th node from the end for a given value of n (n > 0). For example, for the following linked list
// 1-> 2-> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7
//if n = 2, we have to find 2nd node from the end which is node 6.
//if n = 1, we have to find 1st node from the end which is node 7.

//https://www.ideserve.co.in/learn/reverse-a-linked-list-iterative
//Given two numbers which are represented using linked lists as shown below. Return the reference to a new linked list which stores the sum of given two numbers. You are not allowed to make use of explicit extra space except temporary variables.
//
//Numbers are represented as following:
//Number 98976, corresponding linked list: 9->8->9->7->6->null
//Number 198,   corresponding linked list: 1->9->8->null
//
//The output returned by the program for above two linked lists as input should be the linked list 9->9->1->7->4->null
